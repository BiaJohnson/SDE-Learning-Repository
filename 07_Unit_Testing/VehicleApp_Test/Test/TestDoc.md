### 2.2 Results for VehicleViewTest

1.	Code Optimization Suggestion
-	In the turn history display logic, there's an opportunity to optimize the code by removing a redundant conditional check
-	The current code checks if (turnList.length() > 0) before removing trailing comma and space
-	This check appears unnecessary because:
     -	The code block only executes when !turns.isEmpty()
     -	The StringBuilder turnList will always have content due to the for-loop appending characters
-	Suggestion: Consider removing this check to simplify the code while maintaining the same functionality

```
The simplified ode could be:
// Display the turn history
System.out.println("Turn History: ");
if (turns.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("No turns made.");
} else {
    StringBuilder turnList = new StringBuilder();
    for (Character turn : turns) {
        turnList.append(turn).append(", ");
    }
    // Remove the trailing comma and space
    turnList.setLength(turnList.length() - 2);
    System.out.println(turnList.toString());
}
```
